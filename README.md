Data analytics project  using python, SQL, and power Bi.
Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to final business insights. The goal is to analyze the dataset, clean and transform it, extract insights using SQL, and present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a detailed report, and a presentation created using Gamma.
